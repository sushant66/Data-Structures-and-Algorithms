Trees

Hierarchial data structure and non linear


		o   -- root
		
	o      o  -- children
            
o --  leaf    o 



Types of Binary Tree
Full Binary Tree -- Either has 0 or 2 children
 	  o
 	 
 	o    o
 
 o    o
 
 
 Complete Binary Tree -- All the levels are completely filled except last level
 						The last level has all nodes in left as possible
 						
 		   o
 			 
 		o      o     
 	
 	o      o       o    --- left missing not allowed
 	
 	
Perfect Binary Tree  -- All leaf nodes are at same level
		
		 o
	
	 o       o
	 
   o   o   o    o
   

Balanced Binary Tree -- Height of tree at max log(N)
	n = 8   log 8  = 3    n -- number of nodes
			   2
   
   		o   	    for n = 3 log 3 = 1 level
   	  o             so this tree is invalid as it has 3 levels
   	o
   
Degenerate Tree --- When every node has only single child 
	eg the tree above
	
	
Tree Traversal
BFS/DFS

DFS Traversals 
	Apply formula at each sub tree
	
	Inorder Traversal   (left root right)
	
	(4 2 5) 1 (6 3 7)
	
	4 2 8 5 1 6 3 7 10
	
	Pre Order Traversal  (root left right)
	
	(1) (2 4 5) (3 6 7)
	
	1 2 4 5 8 3 6 7 10
	
	Post Order Traversal  (left right root)
	
	(4 5 2) (6 7 3) (1) 
	
	4 8 5 2 6 10 7 3 1
	
BFS Traversal/ Level Order Traversal
	It travels level wise
	
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7
	
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10
	
   
   
We cannot construct a unique binary tree from preorder and postorder
It can be done using preorder inorder or inorder postorder
